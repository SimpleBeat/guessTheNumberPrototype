# Guess the Number

*You have several attempts to guess the number the computer picked*

This is a prototype of a number guessing game. I used it in my SwiftUI developer mini-course at the school. The students start with this prototype and we work through the refactoring process, learning about the best practices, programming patterns, and so on.
